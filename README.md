From Google Sheets and punch cards to a single-click order! This project was made to streamline the process of managing and scheduling dishes by our company chef, as well as placing orders by the employees.

## Overview

Instead of each morning sending the dishes available for today to the reception desk and them sending an email to the employees, now the chef could easily do it by himself! Just fill the form for a new dish, choose a date, and click a button to send an email.

After scheduling some dishes and distributing them by email, the users could order them in a simple UI. When the dishes are ready, the chef would let the users know with a click of a button.

Instead of getting a 10-hole punch card and punching it for every order you make, now nothing needs to be done! The accounting department could charge employees by exporting their orders directly from the admin panel.
